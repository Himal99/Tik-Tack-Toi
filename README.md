<h5>What is an Tick-Tack-Toi?</h5>
Tick-Tack-Toi is a custom dependency for the Java language that functions as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, similar to Hibernate. It provides a convenient and efficient way to map Java objects to relational database tables, allowing developers to interact with the database using object-oriented paradigms.

Here are some key features and concepts related to Tick-Tack-Toi:

<b>1. Mapping Entities: Tick-Tack-Toi allows developers to map Java classes to database tables. By using annotations or configuration files, developers can specify the mapping details such as table name, column names, and relationships between entities.

2. Persistence Context: Tick-Tack-Toi manages a persistence context, which represents the current state of the objects being persisted. It tracks changes made to the objects and synchronizes them with the database when necessary.

3. CRUD Operations: The framework provides methods and APIs to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the mapped entities. Developers can easily save, retrieve, update, and delete objects without writing complex SQL queries manually.

4. Relationships and Associations: Tick-Tack-Toi supports various types of relationships between entities, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many associations. These relationships can be defined using annotations or configuration files.

5. Query Language: Tick-Tack-Toi includes a query language, similar to Hibernate's HQL (Hibernate Query Language) or JPA's JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language). It allows developers to write database queries using object-oriented syntax, making it easier to work with complex data retrieval scenarios.

6. Integration with Java EE and Spring: Tick-Tack-Toi is designed to integrate seamlessly with Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Spring frameworks. It leverages their features, such as container-managed transactions and dependency injection, to enhance application development.

7. Extensibility: Tick-Tack-Toi allows developers to extend its functionality by implementing custom type mappings, converters, and interceptors. This flexibility enables customization to meet specific application requirements. </b>

Overall, Tick-Tack-Toi aims to simplify database interactions in Java applications by providing a robust ORM solution. It abstracts away the complexities of SQL and database operations, allowing developers to focus on their domain models and business logic.
